# FirstCPP

After nearly two decades away from C++, I am exploring the language again with modern tools like CMake.

## Purpose

This project is a hands-on return to modern C++. The goal is to relearn core concepts, experiment with current tools, and build a small but solid foundation for future projects.

## Requirements

* **C++ compiler** with C++17 or later support
* **CMake** 3.20 or newer
* **Visual Studio Code** with the C++ extension (for IDE support)

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TusharKarsan/FirstCPP.git
cd FirstCPP
```

Create a build directory and run CMake:

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Run the executable from the build folder.

## Project Structure

```
FirstCPP/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── src/
│   └── main.cpp
└── build/
```

* `src` contains source files
* `CMakeLists.txt` defines the build configuration
* `build` is where compiled output goes

## Notes

This project evolves as I revisit C++ techniques and features. Expect gradual updates and small experiments along the way.
